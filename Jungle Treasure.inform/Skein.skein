You have sailed from England around Cape Horn to the deep Peruvian jungle in search of ancient Incan Treasure. Your local guide points you towards an area of dense trees and tells you "The treasure can be found in a hidden temple deep in the rainforest." He can not lead you to it since the tribesman will attack anyone who comes close to the temple containing the treasure. You should start looking for it now so you can return before it is dark.

You have sailed from England around Cape Horn to the deep Peruvian jungle in search of ancient Incan Treasure. Your local guide points you towards an area of dense trees and tells you "The treasure can be found in a hidden temple deep in the rainforest." He can not lead you to it since the tribesman will attack anyone who comes close to the temple containing the treasure. You should start looking for it now so you can return before it is dark.
